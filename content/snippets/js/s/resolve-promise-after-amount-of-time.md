Ever wanted to create an artificial pause in your JavaScript code? Did you incidentally need it to be a `Promise` instead of a simple `setTimeout()`? Well, you're in luck, because it's quite easy to create a promise that resolves after a given amount of time.

All you have to do is create a new promise using the `Promise()` constructor, and then use `setTimeout()` to call the promise's `resolve` function with the passed `value` after the specified `delay`.

```js
const resolveAfter = (value, delay) =>
  new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(value), delay);
  });

resolveAfter('Hello', 1000);
// Returns a promise that resolves to 'Hello' after 1s
```
